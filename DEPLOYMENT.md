## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **App won't start**
   - Check environment variables are set
   - Verify `requirements.txt` is present
   - Check logs in Railway dashboard

2. **Cannot login**
   - Ensure `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` and `DASHBOARD_OTP` are set
   - Check credentials match your .env file

3. **Data not persisting**
