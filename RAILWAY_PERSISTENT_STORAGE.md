# üîí Railway Persistent Storage Setup

## Problem
Railway's default deployment resets all data when code is pushed. This causes data loss.

## Solution: Railway Volume Mounts

### Step 1: Add Volume to Railway
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **"Variables"** tab
4. Click **"New Variable"**
5. Add: `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH=/app/secure_data`
6. Add: `RAILWAY_PERSISTENT_VOLUME=true`

### Step 2: Update Server Configuration
The server already creates the `secure_data` directory, but we need to ensure it persists.

### Step 3: Test Persistent Storage
1. Add a website to your dashboard
2. Commit code changes
3. Verify data persists after deployment

## Alternative: External Database
If volumes don't work, consider:
- Railway PostgreSQL addon
- External database service
- Cloud storage integration

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions disabled (preventing auto-deployments)
- ‚è≥ Railway volume configuration needed
- ‚è≥ Testing required

## Next Steps
1. Configure Railway volumes
2. Test data persistence
3. Re-enable backup system (with safety measures)
